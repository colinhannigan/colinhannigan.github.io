  <h1 class="page-title">Measures of Association with Chi-square tests</h1>
  
  
<p>While chi-square tells us where the relationship is significant, the measures of association tell us how strong the relationship.</p>
<p><strong>PRE:</strong> Proportional Reduction in Error</p>
<p><br>Assessing the predictive value/strength of the test:</p>
<p><strong>Cramer's <em>V</em>:</strong> nominal by nominal<br><strong>Somers' <em>d: </em></strong>ordinal by ordinal<strong><em> </em></strong>(symmetric or asymmetric, DV/IV <em>known</em>)<em></em><strong><em><br></em>Gamma: </strong>ordinal by ordinal (asymmetrical/rectangle, DV/IV unknown)<em></em><strong><em><br></em></strong><strong>Tau-b: </strong>ordinal by ordinal<strong> </strong>(symmetrical/square)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cramer's <em>V</em> is measured from 0 to 1; Somers' <em>d</em>, Tau-b, Gamma are from -1 to 1.</p>
<ul>
<li>From 0.0 to +/- 0.1: <em>very </em>weak relationship</li>
<li>From +/- 0.1 to 0.2: weak relationship</li>
<li>From +/- 0.2 to 0.3: moderate relationship</li>
<li>From +/- 0.3 to 1.0: strong relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>For Gamma (Î³), we also care about significance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gamma tells us how well the categories "match" each other</li>
<li>As the IV categories move from left to right, how consistent is the pattern among the DV categories?</li>
<li>When gamma is <strong>significant</strong>, we can interpret the strength of the relationship just like above. When it's not, we can't.</li>
</ul>
